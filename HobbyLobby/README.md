### Setup

The project is based on Gradle. You can use Android Studio to import
the project. You will also need to register for and add a Google Maps API key.
The Google Play Services and Location needs to be turned on.

#### Adding Google Maps API key

Follow the instructions for [setting up Google Maps for
Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get_an_android_certificate_and_the_google_maps_api_key).
You need to obtain an API key and add it to the [AndroidManifest.xml]


### Firebase

The project loads location data from a set maintained by [Firebase](https://firebase.com).

This application loads its Firebase and GeoFire dependencies from Maven Central.

### GeoFire â€” Realtime location queries with Firebase

GeoFire is set of open-source libraries for JavaScript, Objective-C, and Java that allow you to store and query a set of keys based on their geographic location. GeoFire stores locations with string keys. Its main benefit, however, is the possibility of retrieving only those keys within a given geographic area - all in realtime.

GeoFire uses the Firebase database for data storage, allowing query results to be updated in realtime as they change. GeoFire selectively loads only the data near certain locations, keeping the applications light and responsive, even with extremely large datasets. 


### Integrating GeoFire with the data

GeoFire is designed as a lightweight add-on to Firebase. To keep things simple, GeoFire stores data in its own format and its own location within Firebase database. This allows the existing data format and security rules to remain unchanged while still providing  with an easy solution for geo queries.
